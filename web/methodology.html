    <h1>Methodology — How Payment Link Verifier makes decisions</h1>
    <p>
      PLV is designed as a fast, client-side triage tool to help teams and operators quickly identify potentially risky payment links. It intentionally focuses on lightweight, explainable signals that can be evaluated without contacting third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Primary signals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protocol & host:</strong> non-HTTPS links and unusual hostnames increase risk weighting.</li>
      <li><strong>Keyword heuristics:</strong> tokens like "payee-", "verify-", "invoice-now", "update" suggest urgency or automated prompts used by attackers.</li>
      <li><strong>Shortener detection:</strong> common URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, t.co) raise suspicion because they hide destination domains.</li>
      <li><strong>TLD & domain patterns:</strong> recently-registered domains, uncommon TLDs, and lookalike domains (character swaps) are penalized.</li>
      <li><strong>Web3 address extraction:</strong> PLV detects on-chain addresses embedded in URLs and surfaces an explorer link for manual verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring & thresholds</h2>
    <p>
      Each signal contributes to a simple score aggregated into a 0–100 range. The UI surfaces a human-friendly verdict (Safe vs Risky) and the numeric score. Thresholds are intentionally conservative to reduce false negatives.
    </p>

    <h2>False positives & human review</h2>
    <p>
      PLV is a first-stage triage. We recommend integrating PLV results into a workflow where suspicious items are routed for manual review before any financial action is taken.
    </p>

    <h2>Open & auditable</h2>
    <p>
      The heuristics are intentionally simple and auditable. You can run the project locally, inspect the code, or adapt rules for your organisation. For enterprise environments, we recommend self-hosting any aggregation endpoints and combining PLV with additional reputation services.
